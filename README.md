# ðŸš¨ðŸ†˜ Hospital Management System ðŸš¨ðŸ†˜
A Hospital Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to manage the various aspects of hospital operations efficiently. It integrates processes like patient 
registration, appointment scheduling, medical records management, billing, and inventory tracking into a unified platform. The system allows healthcare professionals to access patient 
data quickly, streamline diagnosis, and improve treatment planning. It also facilitates resource allocation, staff management, and reporting, enhancing the overall patient experience. 
By automating administrative tasks, a Hospital Management System reduces errors, increases productivity, and enables better decision-making in delivering quality healthcare services.

## Project Overview
Hospital Management System using Dart language that utilizes various Dart concepts along with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project will cover the management of 
patients, doctors, appointments, and medical records. It will include a demonstration of OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, enums, mixins, 
collections, control flow, and more. 

The Hospital Management System will consist of the following components:

#### Classes and Objects
Represent doctors, patients, appointments, and medical records.

#### Inheritance
Different types of doctors will inherit from a base doctor class.

#### Polymorphism
Different behaviors for appointment scheduling and handling.

#### Abstraction
Abstract class to handle general staff operations.

#### Mixins
For reusable functionalities.

#### Enums
To manage patient status and appointment status.

#### Collections
To handle data storage for patients, doctors, and appointments.

#### Control Flow
For decision-making processes like appointment scheduling.

#### Exception Handling
To manage errors during patient registration or appointment scheduling.

#### Encapsulation
To secure data within classes.

## Classes Design
The following classes will be implemented in the system:

###### a: Person (Base abstract class)
###### b: Doctor, Patient (Derived classes)
###### c: Appointment
###### d: MedicalRecord
###### e: HospitalManagement (Main class for hospital operations)

## Explanation of Concepts Used
#### Classes and Objects: 
The project includes classes like Person, Doctor, Patient, Appointment, MedicalRecord, and HospitalManagement.

#### Inheritance: 
Doctor and Patient classes inherit from the Person base class.

#### Polymorphism: 
Different behaviors for handling appointments and medical records.

#### Abstraction: 
The base class Person provides a template for all person types.

#### Mixins: 
These can be used to add common functionalities, like extra services for doctors or patient care.

#### Enums: 
To manage AppointmentStatus and PatientStatus.

#### Collections:
Lists are used to manage doctors, patients, appointments, and medical records.

#### Control Flow:
Applied in decision-making processes during appointment scheduling.

#### Exception Handling:
Basic error handling for the scheduling and status update process.

#### Encapsulation:
Data related to doctors, patients, and appointments is secured within their respective classes.

## Key Features Highlighted

##### Object-Oriented Concepts: 
Demonstrates inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

##### Practical Use of Dart Features:
Shows usage of enums, collections, control flow, and exception handling.

##### Realistic Hospital Workflow:
Simulates a hospital's day-to-day operations with patient management, doctor assignments, appointment handling, and medical records.
